# Image-Captioning
This image captioning project is based on CNN-LSTM model.
Here a pretrained Xception model is used  as CNN for feature extraction and LSTM for sequence prediction.
You can try with other pretrained models like vggnet,resnet,inception models instead of Xception model.
The dataset used is Flickr8k.
You can download the dataset from this link.
